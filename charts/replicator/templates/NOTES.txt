The Kurrent Replicator has been deployed. It might take some time before the pod starts.

Open the Replicator UI using port forwarding.

1. Establish the proxy connection to the service:

kubectl port-forward --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} svc/{{ template "replicator.fullname" . }} 5000

2. Open http://localhost:5000
