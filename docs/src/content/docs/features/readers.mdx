A source is a where Replicate reads events that are replicated to a [sink](../sinks/).
Replicator supports the following sources:

## KurrentDB

When replicating events from EventStoreDB v20+ or KurrentDB, use the KurrentDB source.

You need to specify two configurations options for it:

- `replicator.reader.protocol` - set to `grpc`
- `replicator.reader.connectionString` - use the source cluster [connection string](https://docs.kurrent.io/clients/grpc/getting-started.html#connection-string), which you'd use for the regular client.

For example, for a Kurrent Cloud cluster the connection string would look like:

`esdb+discover://<username>:<password>@<cluster_id>.mesdb.eventstore.cloud`.

Using gRPC gives you more predictable write operation time. For example, on a C4-size instance in Google Cloud Platform, one write would take 4-5 ms, and this number allows you to calculate the replication process throughput, as it doesn't change much when the database size grows.

## EventStoreDB TCP <Badge text="Legacy" variant="note" />

The TCP source should only be used when migrating from an older version cluster, for example Event Store v5 or earlier.

For the TCP sink, you need to specify two configurations options for it:

- `replicator.reader.protocol` - set to `tcp`
- `replicator.reader.connectionString` - use the target cluster connection string, which you'd use for the TCP client.

Check the connection string format and options in the [TCP client documentation](https://docs.kurrent.io/clients/tcp/dotnet/21.2/connecting.html#connection-string).
